		<h2>Heisman Front Runners</h2>
		
		
		
		<h3>Caleb Williams, QB, USC</h3>
		<img src="images/caleb-williams.jpg" alt="Image of Caleb Williams passing against Oregon State" class="center">
		<p>Caleb Williams was a highly touted quarterback that originally committed to Oklahoma, before transferring to USC this past season. In 2022, Williams was easily one of the best quarterbacks in the country as we was top-5 in both passing yards (4,537) and passing touchdowns (42). This year, he looks to build off of last years success and take home the Heisman trophy and potientially become the number one overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft</p>
		
		<h3>Drake Maye, QB, UNC</h3>
		<img src="images/drake-maye.jpg" alt="Image of Drake Maye rolling out to his right against Florida A&M" class="center">
		<p>Drake Maye committed to UNC as a four-star recruit, but played like a five-star. He started at quarterback for UNC as just a true freshman and took the college football world by storm. He was 4th in passing yards in the nation with 4,321 yards and was tied for 5th in touchdown passes with 38. Maye looks to build off of last years success and avoid the ever so common 'sophomore slump' and take home the Heisman trophy and perhaps even more.</p>
		
		<h3>Michael Penix Jr., QB, Washington</h3>
		<img src="images/penix-jr.jpg" alt="Image of Michael Penix Jr. throwing a deep ball against Washington State" class="center">
		<p>Michael Penix Jr. had a phenomenal season last year with the Washington Huskies. Penix proved to be one of the most dynamic quarterbacks in the country as he can beat you with both his electric arm and elite playmaking ability with his legs. Don't be shocked if Penix Jr. takes home the hardware in the 2023-2024 college football season</p>

		

		<h2>Heisman Dark Horses</h2>

		

		<h3>Joe Milton, QB, Tennessee</h3>
		<img src="images/joe-milton.jpg" alt="Image of Joe Milton loading up before he passes it deep" class="center">
		<p>Joe Milton is finally getting his chance to hit the field after transferring away from Michigan two years ago. He will have some big shoes to fill with the departure of 3rd round NFL draft pick Hendon Hooker. Milton will be surrounded by a great Tennessee offense and will have a chance to run the table this year and contend for a college football playoff spot. If everything goes absolutely right, don't be surprised if Joe Milton is one of the three players invited to New York for the Heisman Ceremony</p>

		<h3>Blake Corum, RB, Michigan</h3>
		<img src="images/blake-corum.jpg" alt="Image of Blake Corum running past a Washington defender" class="center">
		<p>I know the Heisman has become somewhat of a quarterback award, but if any non-quarterback has a shot of winning, it's Blake Corum. Being a running back at Michigan under coach Jim Harbaugh means that he will get plenty of carries which will allow him to build on his 1,463 yard and 18 touchdown 2022 season. </p>

		<h3>Cameron Rising, QB, Utah</h3>
		<img src="images/cam-rising.jpg" alt="Image of Cameron Rising during the 2022 Rose Bowl against Ohio State" class="center">
		<p>Cam Rising essentially defines what it means to be a dark horse. Every year, he seems to come into the season flying under the radar and then next thing you know Utah is undefeated late in the season with a shot to make the playoff. Rising doesn't have the same stats as the other Heisman front runners, but he is an absolute gamer and shows up in the big moments. Don't be surprised at all if Utah runs the table and Rising has his 'Heisman Moment' late in the season on the national stage.</p>
